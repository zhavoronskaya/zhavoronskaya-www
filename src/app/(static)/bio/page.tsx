      <p>
        Born in Moscow in the early 90s to a family of physicists and engineers,
        I delved into the world of computer music during the 2000s while
        studying at a contemporary music school. It was here that I first
        encountered synthesizers and electronic music, marking the beginning of
        my exploration in this fascinating realm. My time at the school's
        computer music department was transformative, especially in the study of
        musical modeling. This coursework involved the intriguing process of
        transforming graphic and natural objects into musical compositions. It
        was like decoding the wonders of sound reality, where the buzzing of a
        bee or the fury of a storm could be transmuted into musical forms, such
        as a delicate piano trio. These experiences marked the inception of my
        journey into the magical world where the realms of technology and music
        intertwine.

      <h2 className="mt-md mb-xs">SEARCH</h2>
      <p>
        At the age of 18, I embarked on my inaugural venture into independent
        music, immersing myself in an avant-garde project intricately woven with
        rock/metal influences within the local underground scene. Armed with a
        saxophone as my primary instrument, I concurrently delved into the art
        of utilizing field recordings. The project, aptly named{" "}
        <a href="https://thecrawlingchaos.bandcamp.com/">
          “The Crawling Chaos”
        </a>{" "}
        drew inspiration from the vast Lovecraftian Universe.
        <br />
        In those early days, my brother secured a rehearsal room, providing a
        space for the fusion of noise segments with relentless jam sessions. The
        culmination of this period resulted in my first album-collaboration,{" "}
        <a href="https://zhavoronskaya.bandcamp.com/album/sputnik-lell-22">
          Sputnik LELL-22
        </a>{" "}
        which only saw the light of day in 2017, coinciding with the inception
        of my solo project. The title paid homage to the Soviet synthesizer.
        <br />
        This phase marked a pivotal point in crystallizing my musical interests.
        It dawned on me that the allure of cross-genre exploration and
        eclecticism resonated most profoundly with my artistic sensibilities. I
        found joy in seamlessly blending synthetic and analog sounds, infusing
        compositions with elements of field recordings, and avidly seeking out
        rare and unconventional sonic combinations.

      <h2 className="mt-md mb-xs">SOLO</h2>
      <p>
        My first solo-project started in Kyiv in 2017. Initially centered around
        the slogan 'Noise against war,' it was a conceptual exploration of noise
        with a pronounced anti-war agenda. During this phase, I engaged
        extensively with video production and witnessed the emergence of my
        interest in thematic samples and experimental electronics. Gradually,
        the prominence of noise in my work receded. As my solo project evolved,
        I found myself broadening my thematic scope piece by piece. While the
        anti-war stance persisted, my focus expanded beyond the realm of
        conflict to encompass various internal states of the human experience. I
        became particularly intrigued by how these states could be translated
        into musical expressions. Concurrently, I delved into textual work,
        documenting my observations about the world through an audio recorder.
        This introspective journey yielded the birth of several albums, each a
        manifestation of my observations and evolving artistic exploration.
        Albums such as{" "}
        <a href="https://zhavoronskaya.bandcamp.com/album/zhavoronskaya-r">
          'R'
        </a>
        , <a href="https://zhavoronskaya.bandcamp.com/album/pcp">'PCP'</a>,{" "}
        <a href="https://zhavoronskaya.bandcamp.com/album/zhavoronskaya-neurotransmission-ep">
          'neurotransmission'
        </a>
        ,{" "}
        <a href="https://zhavoronskaya.bandcamp.com/album/gone-beyond-remastered-white-half-moon">
          'White half moon'
        </a>
        ,{" "}
        <a href="https://zhavoronskaya.bandcamp.com/album/i-dream-in-dreams">
          'i dream in dreams'.
        </a>{" "}
        emerged as tangible results of this transformative process.

      <h2 className="mt-md mb-xs">NOWADAYS</h2>
      <p>
        As a result of my love for interdisciplinarity, music and its visual
        accompaniment are an alliance of science, technology, and art.
        <br />
        Now generative art is becoming more and more enjoyable for me, as an
        opportunity to work with new languages and algorithms, as well as to
        combine the knowledge of a programmer and musical creativity.
