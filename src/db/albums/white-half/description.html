Compilation of two albums on Vinyl LP. <br />
One of them is the re-released EP “Gone Beyond” which transmits some personal
feelings about coexisting with the marine world. The second is inspired by Arab
world and long-standing love for Muslimgauze. Worked with materials from three
wars in the East (Syria, Iraq, and Chechnya). <br />
Used a lot of various stringed instruments like gusli, finish kantele, and field
recordings. <br />
